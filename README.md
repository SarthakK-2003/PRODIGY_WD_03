**Tic Tac Toe Game**

**Overview:**
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was completed as part of an internship task to demonstrate proficiency in front-end web development technologies.

**Instructions:**
To play the game, simply open the `port.html` file in your preferred web browser. The game interface will load, allowing you to start playing immediately. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their respective markers (either 'X' or 'O'). The first player to align three of their markers in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

**Features:**
Responsive design: The game interface adjusts to different screen sizes, allowing for seamless gameplay on various devices.
Dynamic updates: The game board updates in real-time as players make their moves, providing instant feedback.
Clear UI: The user interface is intuitive and easy to understand, ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience for players of all ages.
